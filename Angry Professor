Problem Statement:
An angry professor is determining whether or not to cancel a class based on how many students show up on time. The class will be canceled if the number of students who arrive on time is less than a given threshold k. If the number of students arriving on time is at least k, the class will proceed.

Inputs:
The first line contains two integers, n (the number of students) and k (the threshold number of students who must be present on time to avoid cancellation).
The second line contains n integers, where each integer represents the arrival time of a student. A negative number means the student arrived early or exactly on time, and a positive number means the student was late.
Output:
If the number of students who arrive on time (i.e., arrival time â‰¤ 0) is less than k, print "YES", indicating the class is canceled.
Otherwise, print "NO", indicating the class is not canceled.
example :
i/p
2
4 3
-1 -3 4 2
4 2
0 -1 2 1
o/p
YES
NO
solution :
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
    {
       int n,key;
       cin>>n>>key;
       int v[n];
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           cin>>v[i];
       }
       int count=0;
    for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
    {
        if(v[j]<=0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if(count>=key)
    {
        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
    }
    else 
    {
       cout<<"YES"<<endl;
    }
       
    }
    return 0;
}
